# SoulSync AI Platform

## Overview
SoulSync AI is a platform designed to recreate deceased loved ones as interactive, lifelike NPCs (Non-Player Characters) using AI technologies. Users can upload photos, videos, and other personal information to generate a 2D avatar that can engage in real-time conversations, powered by advanced AI models. The platform integrates HeyGen for 2D avatar creation, Inworld for conversational AI, and Wav2Lip for real-time lip sync.

## System Architecture

### Components
1. **User Dashboard (React)**
   - Collects user data (photos, videos, questionnaires).
   - Provides an interface for interaction with the generated NPC.

2. **Data Storage (Firebase)**
   - Stores user-uploaded data securely.
   - Facilitates data retrieval for processing.

3. **Avatar Generation (HeyGen)**
   - Creates 2D avatars from user-uploaded photos and videos.
   - Provides customization options for avatars.

4. **Conversational AI (Inworld)**
   - Generates AI-driven NPCs with distinct personalities and memories.
   - Handles real-time conversations and long-term memory.

5. **Lip Sync (Wav2Lip)**
   - Synchronizes lip movements with AI-generated speech.
   - Ensures realistic and accurate lip sync for 2D avatars.

## Data Flow

1. **User Data Collection**
   - Users upload photos, videos, and fill out questionnaires via the React dashboard.
   - Data is stored in Firebase for processing.

2. **Avatar Generation**
   - The backend retrieves user data from Firebase.
   - Sends data to HeyGen API to generate a 2D avatar.
   - Avatar is stored and linked to the user's profile.

3. **Character Creation**
   - User data is sent to Inworld API to create an AI character.
   - Character traits, personality, and memory are configured based on the questionnaire responses.

4. **Lip Sync Integration**
   - Inworld generates real-time conversational output.
   - Wav2Lip processes the speech output to generate synchronized lip movements.
   - The 2D avatar's lip movements are updated in real-time based on the processed data.

5. **Frontend Display**
   - The React dashboard displays the generated 2D avatar.
   - Users can interact with the avatar in real-time, with synchronized lip movements and conversational AI.
